This tool aims to automate the final steps before you publish your mod. It can pack both Steam Workshop and non-Steam Workshop variants. You can pack a single mod or you can specify a group of mods that will be packed in one go, but will still remain as separate mods. You can also pack a group of mods into a single package. It uses SCS Game Archive Packer.

You can see more information on how to use it on Github: https://github.com/TomasMahdal/Advanced-Mod-Packer-for-SCS/
